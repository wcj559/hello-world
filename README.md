Repository for hello world

Hello,

I have programmed for most of my career in BASIC and VisualBasic but not in VB.net. I have written file manipulation scripts using VBscript and I'm pretty proficient with VBA. 

I have worked on ETL projects with SQL and Microsoft's SSIS.

Currently I'm working on learning Python 3 and have taken courses in HTML, Javascript and CSS although I haven't used them much and will need refresher courses for them.

I would love to be able to use my coding skill to make money one day.
